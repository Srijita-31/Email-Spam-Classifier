**#Email Spam Classifier**
**#Overview**
This project is designed to detect and classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a variety of machine learning algorithms to accurately predict
spam emails, making it a valuable tool for enhancing email security.
**#Features**
**Data Cleaning**: Cleans and processes raw email text data.
**Feature Extraction**: Extracts important features using techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings.
**Model Building**: Trains multiple machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, SVM, and Random Forest,AdaBoost to classify emails.
**Evaluation**: Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy and precision. 
**Deployment**: Provides an easy-to-use API for integrating the classifier into email systems.
**Technologies Used:**
Natural Language Processing (NLP), Python, Jupyter Notebook
