# Email Spam Classifier

## Overview

This project aims to detect and classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam). By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a variety of machine learning algorithms, the classifier is designed to accurately identify spam emails, making it an essential tool for improving email security.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Efficiently cleans and preprocesses raw email text data to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilizes techniques like TF-IDF and word embeddings to extract crucial features from the email content.
- **Model Building:** Trains multiple machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, to achieve high classification accuracy.
- **Evaluation:** Assesses model performance with key metrics such as accuracy and precision to ensure reliability.
- **Deployment:** Offers an easy-to-use API for seamless integration of the classifier into existing email systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
